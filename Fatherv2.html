It&#x27;s the first door of the corridor and yet, you ignored it. He might have been there this whole time. A pot of gel on the counter is open. You didn&#x27;t pay attention to it but he is indeed wearing his hair up today.

You notice a little razor on the top-left corner of the sink. It looks way more ancient than the ones Larry uses.

[[Observe the razor]]

A vase seems to be breaking and multiple boxes fall down. The sounds get muffled. Groans and signs of struggle. It&#x27;s like a fight is going on.

[[Stay inside the room. If an intruder is in the house you have to stay inside!|Bad ending 1-1]]

[[Get out and help dad]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Bad ending 1-1" tags="" position="787,2273">You push your ear against the door, your heart beating uncontrollably.

More muffled sounds. Someone groaning.

Then steps coming through the hallway. Running toward [[you|Bad ending 1-2]].

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="Bad ending 1-2" tags="" position="801,2512">The handle of the door you are currently leaning against starts moving. Once, twice, now more and more. Soon, it&#x27;s uncontrollable. 

You get back a little, your hands shaking. The back of your legs meet something cold and you have just enough reflexes to grab the edge of the tub and make your fall less abrupt. 

The person thumps on the door and start screaming.

&quot;Who&#x27;s in there?&quot;

Your heart skips a beat. It&#x27;s your [[father|Bad ending 1-3]]&#x27;s voice.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Bad ending 1-3" tags="" position="682,2748">&quot;Dad?&quot;
&quot;Alex? Is that you?&quot;

You painfully get yourself back up. You ignore the pain in your lower back and run up to the door. 

Someone on the other side is doing the same. Heavy footsteps suddenly come to your father. You hear, a shriek of pain and the sound of a loud and cutting object piercing a skull. Someone falls on the floor. 

Blood starts dripping under the door.

&quot;You can [[come out]], Alex!&quot; says your dad.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="come out" tags="" position="835,2716">You come out of the bathroom and see a disfigured silhouette on the floor. It&#x27;s wearing a Hawaiian shirt, exactly like one of your fathers. The corpse is of the same height and body shape as your Dad.

Yet your father is standing right next to it. His green shirt bloody, an axe in his hand. You fall to your knees, throwing up after such a scene - a sight you would never forget. Your dad quickly pulls a tablecloth from the kitchen and puts it over the body.

&quot;I&#x27;m sorry you had to see this my love...&quot;

Heavy tears run down your cheeks. Your throat is burning. You realize you fell down in the blood. It&#x27;s all over your knees.

&quot;He started chasing me during my vacations. Said I had something that was his. I met him after going to a fortune teller. I&#x27;m glad I got rid of him now&quot;

You don&#x27;t really know where to hit. It doesn&#x27;t really look like you could stab him but you ould take him by surprise.

You cut a clumsy but deep cut in his shoulder and which takes him by surprise. He turns around, a painful grin upon his face. You recognize him despite it. He has a your father&#x27;s face.

[[What?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="run up to him" tags="" position="782,2903">You try to hug your father but he keeps you from hugging him. You look at him.

“I&#x27;m full of blood.”

He puts his hand on your shoulder.

“Do you think the police will be there soon?”

“Let&#x27;s not call them! They won&#x27;t believe you.”

“Believe me?”

“Us! What will we tell them about all this? We have to bury the body. Clean up. And when it&#x27;s done we will call and say that we have been roobbed.”

[[Bury the body.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="Bury the body." tags="" position="936,2900">You and Dad bury the body in the garden. It takes what feels like ages. The body is heavy and neither you nor Dad are strong enough to carrying it. Each step of burying this man that looks so much like your father is torture.

“I almost lost you” Dad constantly repeats “This other one was much stronger than I was. I don&#x27;t thing I would be here right now if you hadn&#x27;t been here.”

The weekend goes back eerily. You feel empty. &lt;div class=&quot;mom&quot;&gt;Mom&lt;/div&gt;is supposed to pick you up after three days but she ends up calling and telling you that she has decided to take a few more days off. Her stay at the hotel was nice. She went where Dad had been before. Loved the fortune teller. She wants to travel more. A couple more days turn into a weeek, then two. Then she doesn&#x27;t even call anymore

[[You live with Dad now]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="You live with Dad now" tags="" position="1011,3101">Every morning Dad wakes you up to go to school. He drives you there. He is never late to meet any of your teachers anymore. He throws the best parties and allows you to go to sleepover. He never misses a play you have a part in.

It&#x27;s all fun and games until you go to bed at night, after watching TV with him. When you get into the bedroom and close your eyes and your mind accidentally goes back to that first night on that first weekend.

After burying the body. The one that looked like him. That very same night, Dad had given you a kiss on the cheek and whispered.

“You and me will be together now. I feel so lucky you were there. This would have never worked otherwise. I love you Alexandra.”

And from then on you could never sleep tight again.

You get confused for a second. Dad doesn&#x27;t really like having visitors. It means he&#x27;d have to clean. Yet the sound inside was pretty clear. And there&#x27;s most definitely someone in the garden.
